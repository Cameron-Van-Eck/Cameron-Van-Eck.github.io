Hello! I'm Dr. Cameron Van Eck, professional astronomer. I am currently (May 2022) a research associate at the [Dunlap Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics](http://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/). My research specialization is radio astronomy, focusing on observations of radio polarization as a tool for studying magnetic fields in astrophysical environments.
