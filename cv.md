### Academic History:

I did my undergraduate and Masters studies at the University of Calgary: 
BSc First Class Honors in Physics and Astrophysics, 2010; MSc Astrophysics 2012. 
Both were under the supervision of Prof. Jo-Anne Brown.

I did my PhD work with Prof. Marijke Haverkorn at Radboud University Nijmegen,
 which lead to my thesis entitled
*Exploring the Threefold Invisible Universe: Low-Frequency Spectropolarimetry with LOFAR as a Probe of Galactic Magnetism*.

After that I returned to Calgary for a 4-month postdoc with Jo-Anne Brown, 
followed by a research associate position with Bryan Gaensler at the Dunlap Institute in Toronto.

Soon (Sep 2022) I will be moving to Australia to take up a position as research fellow in
the group of Prof. Naomi McClure-Griffiths.
